# Big Bear Universal Apps

The **Big Bear Universal Apps** repository is the **single source of truth** for all Big Bear app definitions. Apps are maintained in a universal, platform-agnostic format and automatically converted to platform-specific formats.

## 🎯 Overview

This repository serves as the central hub for Big Bear app definitions. All apps are stored in a standardized universal format and converted to various platform-specific formats:

- **CasaOS** - Home server operating system
- **Portainer** - Container management platform
- **Runtipi** - Self-hosted app platform
- **Dockge** - Docker compose management
- **Cosmos** - Reverse proxy and app platform
- **Umbrel** - Personal server OS

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Adding a New App

1. **Create app directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p apps/myapp
   ```

2. **Create `app.json`** with app metadata (see [SCHEMA.md](SCHEMA.md) for format)

3. **Create `docker-compose.yml`** with a clean, standard Docker Compose file

4. **Convert to all platforms:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/convert-to-platforms.sh -a myapp
   ```

### Converting All Apps

```bash
# Convert all apps to all platforms
./scripts/convert-to-platforms.sh

# Convert to specific platforms only
./scripts/convert-to-platforms.sh -p casaos,portainer,runtipi

# Dry run (preview without making changes)
./scripts/convert-to-platforms.sh --dry-run
```

## 📝 Universal App Format

Apps in this repository use the **Universal App Format** - a comprehensive, platform-agnostic format that contains all necessary metadata and configuration.

### Key Components

1. **`app.json`** - Contains all metadata:
   - App information (name, description, version)
   - Visual assets (icons, thumbnails)
   - Technical requirements (architectures, ports)
   - Deployment configuration
   - Platform compatibility flags

2. **`docker-compose.yml`** - Standard Docker Compose file:
   - Clean, no platform-specific extensions
   - Uses relative paths (e.g., `./data`)
   - Standard Docker Compose v3+ format

See [SCHEMA.md](SCHEMA.md) for complete format documentation and examples.

    G --> M[Sync to big-bear-cosmos]
    H --> N[Sync to big-bear-umbrel]
```

The conversion process:
1. Read universal format from `apps/`
2. Convert to platform-specific formats
3. Output to `converted/<platform>/`
4. Sync converted apps to platform repositories
5. Create pull requests for updates

## 🛠️ Scripts

### `convert-to-platforms.sh`

Converts universal apps to all platform formats.

```bash
# Usage
./scripts/convert-to-platforms.sh [OPTIONS]

# Options
-h, --help              Show help message
-i, --input DIR         Input directory (default: ./apps)
-o, --output DIR        Output directory (default: ./converted)
-p, --platforms LIST    Comma-separated platform list
-a, --app NAME          Convert specific app only
--dry-run              Preview without changes
-v, --verbose          Verbose output

# Examples
./scripts/convert-to-platforms.sh                    # Convert all apps
./scripts/convert-to-platforms.sh -a jellyseerr      # Convert one app
./scripts/convert-to-platforms.sh -p casaos,runtipi  # Specific platforms
```

## 🧪 Validation
